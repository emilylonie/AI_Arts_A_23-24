Some of these topics have been extensively discussed and as a response, Kaggle has developed a course on AI ethics:\n",

Other bias not discussed here, may be temporary bias if the training data only reflects society at the time it was collected, and not the present. Another bias may occur if the variables intertwine and interact significantly, making it difficult to pin-point which variable is the cause.\n",

    "<img src=\"Screenshots/Screenshot1.png\" alt=\"Testing 'I don't like cold weather'\">\n",

    "In this section we will explore the reasons behind decisions that AI makes. While this is really hard to know, there are some approaches developed to know which features in your data (e.g. median_income in the housing dataset we used before) played a more important role than others in determining how your machine learning model performs. One of the many approaches for assessing feature importance is **permutation importance**.\n",

Therefore, my intuition made me guess cities are spread out more by latitude.

Furthermore, if the data itself is not tailored for the best result, the permutation importance may not perform as well. For instance, if there is a lot more data for one feature than the others, this could result in bias.
