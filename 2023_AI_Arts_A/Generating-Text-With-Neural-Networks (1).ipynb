    "## Introduction to the Code\n",
    "The code below is designed to train a model to generate text in the style of William Shakespeare's work. The code utalises Tensorflow which is an open-source library which can be used to build neural networks. Neural networks are artificial intelligence (AI) designed to mimic the way humans think. Therefore, they can be very useful for generating text in the style of a person. The model below was trained on a database of William Shakespeare, it includes various plays (including Romeo & Juliet and Hamlet). "

    "## What can the code be used for?\n",
    "There are many potentials for a text generator such as this, within the humanities. It could be used for educational purposes such as language analysis. The text generated could be used to understand the lingustic styles of that period, or even observe how AI differs from true text of this time. Furthermore, it could be used educationally within nmuseums showcasing his work. Text generators could be used to create Immersive exhibits in the style of Shakespeare. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it could be used as a source of inspiration and creativity. As Shakespeare is regarded as one of the best poets, and playwrites of all time, it makes sense to use his methods of thinking and creativity as inspiration. Even today, popular artists are still comnpared to Shakespeare, despite the centuries of lingustic evelution. For instance, Taylor Swift's recent songwriting has been compared to Shakespeare's with online quizzes to see if players can tell the two apart: https://www.buzzfeed.com/taylorswiftmidnights/evermore-edition-taylor-swift-or-shakespeare. \n",
    "\n",
    "This showcases, how his writing style is still relevant today. Meaning, people in the arts and humanities could use a text generator as a starting point for their own work. "

    "## Weaknesses in this model\n",
    "\n",
    "While the data was trained on several of Shakespeare's plays, providing it with thousands of lines of script, it was missing some key literature. For instance, it fails to include sonnets or plays such as Macbeth and A Midsummer Night's Dream. This means, the model is limited in its knowledge of Shakespeare's writing style, and is less likely to produce text outwith the style of a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, using this method of generating text may be difficult and impractical for those in the humanities. This is due partly due to the coding knowledge needed. However, mainly the amount of time it takes to train neural networks may not be suited to those in the humanities. Depending on the coputer set-up, it may take anywhere for an hour to 20 hours to train the neural networks. If the text generation is needed instantly, it may make more sense for humanities scholars to use an instantaneous method, such as a conversational AI chatbot. There are ways to reduce the time required to train the model, such as training it on less data, or reducing the number of epochs (An epoch is the number of times the model spends looking at the training data). Although, both of these methods would reduce the quality of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see, the output of text generated is not of the highest quality, as it is not logical. This sugests a larger data set should be used, or more epochs should have been used. It also indicates this was not successful for use by humanities scholars and alternatives should be considered."

    "## Final Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation of the result of the generative AI code:\n",
    "While the code generated incoherent text. The training data size needs to be taken into consideration, as well as the time spent training the model. Both of these could have been significantly increased to produce improved results. When this is considered, it is arguabley impressive that the text formed sentences which look like they could have been written by Shakespeare, at a first glance. This is because the model managed to copy Shakespeare's rhythm. Additionally, one could argue that the spelling mistakes and made up words is the model are mimicking Shakespeare's inventiveness with language. As he was known for creating new words which are derived from real words. In my personal opnion, the model is not sophisticated enough to purposefully do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How you might apply your code to your own data:\n",
    "Keeping with the theme of relating Shakespere's work to pop songs, I would be interested in seeing if the model could be trained on a database of pop music. This could be interesting, as perhaps in this case, the model would be able to effectively produce song lyrics in the style of shakespeare. Then it could finally be used as a method of stimulating creativity! In order to do this, I would have to gather a lot of song lyrics into a text file and prepare it the same way we prepared the shakespeare data (by turning them into Tokens!).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ethical concerns \n",
    "There are intellectual property concerns involved with using someone else's material (in this case songs) to train a model. Additionally, if the AI was to produce a song which effectively mimicked their style, this could be reason for concerned as that is their creative style that they have harnessed and defined. There are less concerns with Shakespeare as his work was produced centuries ago (meaning there are no current copyright laws on his work). Despite this, there would still be reason for ethical concerns if text was effectively generated in his style and it was presented to the public as newly discoved work, written by Shakespeare himself.
